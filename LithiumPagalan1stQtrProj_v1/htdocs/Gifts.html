	<p> When we think of our special loved ones, we think of what would suit them. We would think if they look good with shirts, dresses, sweaters, jackets, or accesories. Or we could also think about what they need or what they want. They might need snacks, clothes, cups, cookware and more. Or they might want toys, small trinkets or even jewelries. Nonetheless giving gifts is a special way to show them we care for them.</p>
